# Web calender

Our user-friendly calendar HTML template was made using HTML, CSS, and some simple JavaScript. This aids in keeping track of the user's reminders, everyday activities, and anything he wishes to change in his routine. The project's goal was to employ web-based technologies as effectively as possible in daily life.
